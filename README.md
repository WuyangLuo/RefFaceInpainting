### Reference-Guided Large-Scale Face Inpainting with Identity and Texture Control 
(TCSVT 2023) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07014.pdf)

Face inpainting aims at plausibly predicting missing
pixels of face images within a corrupted region. Most existing
methods rely on generative models learning a face image distribution from a big dataset, which produces uncontrollable results,
especially with large-scale missing regions. To introduce strong
control for face inpainting, we propose a novel reference-guided
face inpainting method that fills the large-scale missing region
with identity and texture control guided by a reference face
image.
